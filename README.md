# VEML6030
Arduino sketch for the VEML6030 ambient light sensor

Set of methods for Vishay's [VEML6030](https://www.vishay.com/docs/84366/veml6030.pdf) ambient light sensor including configuring the integration time, gain, power mode and setting up the interrupt for low and high light level detection. Intended to run suing the CMWX1ZZABZ (STM32L082 + SX1276) MCU but can be easily adapted to almost any I2C-enabled MCU.
